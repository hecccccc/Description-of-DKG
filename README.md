# Description-of-DKG

We use the biomedical literature related to depression on the medical website PubMed as the main data source, and construct the knowledge graph in a bottom-up approach. In addition, we investigate the key techniques involved in the construction process, such as knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, knowledge fusion, and knowledge storage. Finally, a high quality depression knowledge graph with weights, DKG, is constructed, which contains 136,364 triples, among which the number of entities is 37,112 and the number of relationship types is 30.

Table 1 shows the the specific attribute information. Table 2 shows the distribution of the number of various entity types in the knowledge graph, and Table 3 shows the distribution of the number of various relations in the knowledge graph. Here we only show the 10 most numerous relationships.

For some reasons, we set the DKG permission to private. If you can send the github username to my email (hech18@lzu.edu.cn), then I will release the appropriate permission to you.
